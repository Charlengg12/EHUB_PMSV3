## Quick Start (Localhost)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- Supabase account (optional - free tier available at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com))

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone or download the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ehub-project-management
   ```

2. **Install all dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables (Optional)**
   
   The app can run in demo mode without Supabase. For full functionality:
   
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   
   Edit `.env.local` and add your Supabase credentials:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
   SUPABASE_DB_URL=your-database-url
   ```

4. **Deploy Supabase Edge Functions (Optional)**
   
   Only needed if using Supabase backend:
   ```bash
   # Install Supabase CLI globally
   npm install -g supabase
   
   # Login to your Supabase account
   supabase login
   
   # Link to your Supabase project
   supabase link --project-ref your-project-id
   
   # Deploy the server functions
   supabase functions deploy
   ```

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   The application will start at: **http://localhost:3000**

6. **Access the application**
   - Open your browser to http://localhost:3000
   - Create an administrator account to get started
   - The app works in demo mode if Supabase is not configured

### Running Without Supabase (Demo Mode)

The application can run locally without a Supabase backend connection. In this mode:
- Data is stored in memory (lost on refresh)
- All features are available for testing
- Perfect for development and testing
- No external dependencies required

## Usage

### Initial Setup
1. Login with your administrator credentials
2. The system will automatically initialize the database
3. Create supervisor and fabricator accounts as needed

### User Registration
- **Fabricators**: Can self-register through the signup form
- **Supervisors/Admins**: Must be created by existing administrators
- All users receive unique secure IDs (FAB001, SUP001, ADM001, etc.)

### Login Methods
- **All Users**: Can login with email, employee number, or secure ID
- **Multi-Factor Support**: System supports various identifier types

### Forgot Password
- Click "Forgot Password" on login screen
- Enter email address to receive reset instructions
- System sends credentials reminder and reset options
